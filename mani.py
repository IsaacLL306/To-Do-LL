    # I don't belong here, we gotta move on, dear
    # Escape from this afterlife
    # 'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on
    # Far away from here

    # Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
    # This place full of peace and light
    # And I'd hope you might take me back inside
    # When the time is right
